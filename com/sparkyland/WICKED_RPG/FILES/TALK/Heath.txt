 Squiggy Ingina was helping himself down the road when he hollered into
 a
 hollow trashcan. 'Who could have not been in there to not hear my holler,'
 sloshed squiggy. Heaving the can a super-condensed megalomaniacle nudge,
 squigy loosed the sparkle crunchie who had been missing from the can.
 Sparkle crunchie exited his hibernation mask, and bit Squiggy Ingina's
 torso. They became immediate friends. Together, they slithered the
 conveyer
 belts of all major factories and plants of the UK, sniffing out the
 forgotten champions of the skeletal-world. Among their recruits here a
 retired band-aid adhesive machine, a marble-polishing dust cloth, and a
 lonely wafer press. With these influential executives, squiggy and sprkle
 crunchie set up a Pyramid system of sales, fishing for all the minows that
 would eventually make them big fish. The item of trade? Sweatpants? The
 target market? Sleepy white.
